Challenge 1: Retrieve customer data
Adventure Works Cycles sells directly to retailers, who then sell products to consumers. Each retailer that is an Adventure Works customer has provided a named contact for all communication from Adventure Works. The sales manager at Adventure Works has asked you to generate some reports containing details of the company’s customers to support a direct sales campaign.

1. Retrieve customer details
Familiarize yourself with the SalesLT.Customer table by writing a Transact-SQL query that retrieves all columns for all customers.

SELECT *
FROM
    SalesLT.Customer


2. Create a list of all customer contact names that includes the title, first name, middle name (if any), last name, and suffix (if any) of all customers.

SELECT
    Title,
    FirstName,
    MiddleName,
    LastName,
    Suffix
FROM
    SalesLT.Customer

3. Retrieve customer names and phone numbers. Each customer has an assigned salesperson. You must write a query to create a call sheet that lists:
    The salesperson
    A column named CustomerName that displays how the customer contact should be greeted (for example, Mr Smith)
    The customer’s phone number.

I create a calculated column called CustomerName that Concatanates two string column types 

SELECT
    SalesPerson,
    Title + ' ' + LastName AS CustomerName,
    Phone
FROM
    SalesLT.Customer


Challenge 2: Retrieve customer order data
As you continue to work with the Adventure Works customer data, you must create queries for reports that have been requested by the sales team.

1. Retrieve a list of customer companies. You have been asked to provide a list of all customer companies in the format Customer ID : Company Name - for example, 78: Preferred Bikes.

I need to Concatanate Customer ID with string symbol and the string CompanyName. But i can only do that with strings. So i need to convert CustomerID into a string using CAST, converting it to a compatible varchar.  

SELECT 
    CAST(CustomerID AS varchar)  + ': ' + CompanyName AS customer_companies
FROM
    SalesLT.Customer


USING CONCAT:
SELECT 
    CONCAT(CustomerID, ': ', CompanyName) AS customer_companies
FROM 
    SalesLT.Customer;


2. Retrieve a list of sales order revisions
    The SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table contains records of sales orders. You have been asked to retrieve data for a report that shows:
        The purchase order number and revision number in the format * ()* – for example *PO348186287 (2)*.
        The order date converted to ANSI standard 102 format (yyyy.mm.dd – for example 2015.01.31).

CONCAT is way easier to use since it formats everything into string 
I change the OrderDate column value type to DATE 

SELECT
    CONCAT(PurchaseOrderNumber, ' (',RevisionNumber,')*') AS SalesOrderRevisions,    
    CAST(OrderDate AS DATE)
FROM 
    SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader;


Challenge 3: Retrieve customer contact details
Some records in the database include missing or unknown values that are returned as NULL. You must create some queries that handle these NULL values appropriately.

1. Retrieve customer contact names with middle names if known
You have been asked to write a query that returns a list of customer names. The list must consist of a single column in the format first last (for example Keith Harris) if the middle name is unknown, or first middle last (for example Jane M. Gates) if a middle name is known.

I updated the SalesLT.Customer table to add null email records as requested by this exercise:
UPDATE SalesLT.Customer
  SET EmailAddress = NULL
  WHERE CustomerID % 7 = 1;


This solution could be better. When a person is missing a middle name, theres an extra space. 
SELECT
    CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', MiddleName, ' ', LastName) AS customer_contact_names 
FROM SalesLT.Customer
 
Final Solution: 
I used CONCAT_WS which skips NULL values 

SELECT 
    CONCAT_WS(FirstName, MiddleName, LastName) AS customer_contact_names
FROM 
    SalesLT.Customer;


2. Retrieve primary contact details
Customers may provide Adventure Works with an email address, a phone number, or both. If an email address is available, then it should be used as the primary contact method; if not, then the phone number should be used. You must write a query that returns a list of customer IDs in one column, and a second column named PrimaryContact that contains the email address if known, and otherwise the phone number.


Solution: 
I use ISNULL to replace EmailAddress with Phone if its NULL 

SELECT
    CustomerID,
    ISNULL(EmailAddress, Phone) AS PrimaryContact
FROM 
    SalesLT.Customer;


3. Retrieve shipping status
You have been asked to create a query that returns a list of sales order IDs and order dates with a column named ShippingStatus that contains the text Shipped for orders with a known ship date, and Awaiting Shipment for orders with no ship date.

IMPORTANT: In the sample data provided, there are no sales order header records without a ship date. Therefore, to verify that your query works as expected, run the following UPDATE statement to remove some existing ship dates before creating your query.


I run this update to add NULL ShipDate's 

 UPDATE SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
  SET ShipDate = NULL
  WHERE SalesOrderID > 71899;


I used case statements because it asks for specific text for a specific situation, when Shipdate is null
SELECT
    SalesOrderID,
    OrderDate,
    CASE
        WHEN ShipDate IS NOT NULL THEN 'Shipped'
        WHEN ShipDate IS NULL THEN 'Awaiting Shipment'
    END AS ShippingStatus
FROM
    SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader
