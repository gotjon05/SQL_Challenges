SQL Declarative Language: user describes what they want, database engine decides decides actual execution for best optimization 

relational database: data is organized in multiple tables, with distinct data,  related to one another using key columns

Set theory: collection of distinct objects containing zero or more members of the same type.  
    -think of the results as sets, and conceptualize the join results as a Venn diagram

 Cartesian products: Every element in one set is combined with every element in the other set
    -combining every row in one table to every row of another table.
    -Cartesian product not desirable, usually when tables are joined without considering relationships. all combination of rows not typicaly useful 
    -JOIN starts as a cartesian product but ON and WHERE, prevent this 

normalized design: Relational databases, useful for minimizing duplication of data

TSQL Virtual Tables:
    -FROM clause, first clause to be processed, creates the virtual table 
    -logical entity only, not a physical table 

Self Joins
