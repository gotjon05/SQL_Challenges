inner query = subquery that is nested
outer query = main query

Scalar subqueries vs Multi-valued subqueries
    Scalar
        -returns only one value
        -might be used anywhere in an outer query statement 
    multivalued
        -multivalued return result like single table and outer query must return more than one value 


Self-contained subqueries vs Correlated subqueries
    Self Contained 
        -no dependencies on the outer query
    Correlated 
        -reference one or more columns from the outer query and therefore depend on it
        -run multiple times, once per row
