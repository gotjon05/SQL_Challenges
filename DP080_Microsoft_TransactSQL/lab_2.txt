1. Retrieve a list of cities
Initially, you need to produce a list of all of you customers’ locations. Write a Transact-SQL query that queries the SalesLT.Address table and retrieves the values for City and StateProvince, removing duplicates and sorted in ascending order of city.

SELECT
    DISTINCT City,
    StateProvince
FROM 
    SalesLT.Address
Order BY
    City


2. Retrieve the heaviest products
Transportation costs are increasing and you need to identify the heaviest products. Retrieve the names of the top ten percent of products by weight.

When using TOP X PERCENT, order by is critical because it will select any top 10 percent 

SELECT
    TOP 10 PERCENT p.name, 
    p.Weight
FROM 
    SalesLT.Product AS p
ORDER BY
    p.Weight DESC


Challenge 2: Retrieve product data
The Production Manager at Adventure Works would like you to create some reports listing details of the products that you sell.

1. Retrieve product details for product model 1
Initially, you need to find the names, colors, and sizes of the products with a product model ID 1.

SELECT
    p.Name,
    p.Color,
    p.[Size]
FROM
    [SalesLT].[Product] AS p

WHERE ProductModelID = 1

2. Filter products by color and size
Retrieve the product number and name of the products that have a color of black, red, or white and a size of S or M.

SELECT
    p.Name,
    p.Color,
    p.[Size]
FROM
    [SalesLT].[Product] AS p

WHERE size = 'M' AND color IN ('Black','Red','White')

3. Filter products by product number
Retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products whose product number begins BK-

SELECT
    p.ProductNumber,
    p.Name,
    p.ListPrice
FROM 
    SalesLT.Product AS p
WHERE
    p.ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-%'

4. Retrieve specific products by product number
Modify your previous query to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products whose 

product number begins BK- 
followed by any character other than R, 
and ends with a - followed by any two numerals.

% seperates first and last 
[^] not 
[0-9] any 1 digit 

SELECT
    p.ProductNumber,
    p.Name,
    p.ListPrice
FROM 
    SalesLT.Product AS p
WHERE
    p.ProductNumber LIKE 'BK-[^R]%-[0-9][0-9]'
