Challenge 1: Retrieve order shipping information
The operations manager wants reports about order shipping based on data in the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table.

1. 
Retrieve the order ID and freight cost of each order.

Write a query to return the order ID for each order, together with the the Freight value rounded to two decimal places in a column named FreightCost.

-Retrieve order ID and freight for each order
-Round freight value to two decimal places in FreightCost
-Use SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table

SELECT
  SalesOrderID,
  ROUND(Freight,2) AS FreightCost
FROM
  SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader

2. 
Add the shipping method.
Extend your query to include a column named ShippingMethod that contains the ShipMethod field, formatted in lower case.

SELECT
  SalesOrderID,
  ROUND(Freight,2) AS FreightCost,
  LOWER(ShipMethod) AS ShippingMethod
FROM
  SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader

3.
Add shipping date details.
Extend your query to include columns named ShipYear, ShipMonth, and ShipDay that contain the year, month, and day of the ShipDate. The ShipMonth value should be displayed as the month name (for example, June)

SELECT
  SalesOrderID,
  ROUND(Freight,2) AS FreightCost,
  LOWER(ShipMethod) AS ShippingMethod,
  YEAR(ShipDate) AS ShipYear,
  DATENAME(mm, ShipDate) AS ShipMonth,
  DAY(ShipDate) AS ShipDay  
FROM
  SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader


Challenge 2: Aggregate product sales
The sales manager would like reports that include aggregated information about product sales.

1. 
Retrieve total sales by product

Write a query to retrieve a list of the product names from the SalesLT.Product table and the total number of sales of each product, calculated as the sum of OrderQty from the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table, with the results sorted in descending order of total sales

retrieve product names from SalesLT.Product 
retrieve sum of sales from OrderQt in SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
use SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table 
order in DESC of total sales 

SELECT
  p.Name,
  SUM(s.OrderQty) AS total_sales 
FROM
  SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN
  SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS s
ON
  p.ProductID = s.ProductID
GROUP BY
  P.Name
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC

2.
Filter the product sales list to include only products that cost over 1,000

Modify the previous query to include only sales of products that have a list price of more than 1000.

Since cost was not part of the group by, it needed to be applied before the group by in Where instead of Having 


SELECT
  p.Name,
  SUM(s.OrderQty) AS total_sales 
FROM
  SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN
  SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS s
ON
  p.ProductID = s.ProductID
WHERE
  p.ListPrice > 1000
GROUP BY
  P.Name
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC


3. 
Filter the product sales groups to include only products for which over 20 have been sold

Modify the previous query to only include only product groups with a total order quantity greater than 20.

-Filtering the output of GROUP BY 
-Couldnt reference the select for having because it comes after having 

SELECT
  p.Name,
  SUM(s.OrderQty) AS total_sales 
FROM
  SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN
  SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS s
ON
  p.ProductID = s.ProductID
WHERE
  p.ListPrice > 1000
GROUP BY
  P.Name
HAVING
  SUM(s.OrderQty) > 20
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC
